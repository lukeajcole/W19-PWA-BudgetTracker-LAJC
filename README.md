## Description

The [Workout Tracker App](https://agile-eyrie-11044.herokuapp.com/?id=6168f21f7f90cd0016337188) allows you to create a workout and add all of you exercises to it. The exercise can be cardio or resistance. The data for all of the exercises in a workout are displayed in a graph in the dashboard and are broken down for easy viewing on the main page. The app runs on top or a back end that's built with MongoDB and APIs.
